          <i class="fa-solid fa-xmark close-btn-soda"></i>
          <p>
            Irish Soda Bread is a traditional bread that originated in Ireland.
            It is a simple yet delicious bread made with four basic ingredients:
            flour, baking soda, salt, and buttermilk. What sets it apart is the
            use of baking soda instead of yeast as a leavening agent, giving it
            a unique texture and flavor.
          </p>

          <p>
            The bread has a dense and hearty texture with a slightly crumbly
            crust. It has a subtle tanginess from the buttermilk and a slightly
            sweet flavor. The crust is often cross-hatched, which helps with
            even baking and gives it its characteristic appearance.
          </p>
